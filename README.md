# TryHackMe: Boogeyman 1 - Threat Group Analysis Write-up

## Case Overview

** Objective:**  
Investigate a multi-stage attack‚Äîfrom phishing to command and control‚Äîusing forensic artifacts and open-source tools.

** Scope:**
- Analyze phishing email (`dump.eml`)
- Investigate PowerShell activity from logs (`powershell.json`)
- Identify anomalies in captured network traffic (`capture.pcapng`)

## Lessons Learned

- Correlating artifacts across email, endpoint, and network reveals full kill chain visibility.
- Learned how to decode PowerShell payloads and trace encoded commands back to attacker intent.
- Reinforced MITRE ATT&CK as a structured way to document adversary behavior.
